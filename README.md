# Calculator
Calculator project for The Odin Project

I have divided the script for this project in two files:

backend-script - sets up "calculator engine" which means performing operations, safety checks (like division by 0) and working with display/memory
frontend-script - sets up buttons of the calculator with appropriate event listeners (I could add key bindings additionally, maybe in the future update) as well as relationship between calculator data and numbers displayed on the page.
